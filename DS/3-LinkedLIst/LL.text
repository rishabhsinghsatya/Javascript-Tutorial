//Linked List Data Structure:
A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. This allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.

//1. Single-linked list:
In a singly linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. Traversing a singly linked list is done in a forward direction.

//2. Double-linked list:
In a doubly linked list, each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes. This allows for traversal in both forward and backward directions, but it requires additional memory for the backward reference.

//3. Circular linked list:
In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the head node, creating a circular structure. It can be either singly or doubly linked.

Operations on Linked Lists
Insertion: Adding a new node to a linked list involves adjusting the pointers of the existing nodes to maintain the proper sequence. Insertion can be performed at the beginning, end, or any position within the list.

Deletion: Removing a node from a linked list requires adjusting the pointers of the neighboring nodes to bridge the gap left by the deleted node. Deletion can be performed at the beginning, end, or any position within the list.

Searching: Searching for a specific value in a linked list involves traversing the list from the head node until the value is found or the end of the list is reached.
